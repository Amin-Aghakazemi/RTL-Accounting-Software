## Introduction

Welcome to the RTL Accounting repository.

RTL Accounting Software is a finance management Windows application tailored for small businesses, designed to handle specific spending and income transactions effectively. 

Small businesses can easily define their specific income and expenditure items, and then add each purchase or sale made within their business.

The project includes clean and structured code, built within the Three-Layer Architecture. This architecture divides the application into three logical layers:

- Presentation Layer: Handles user interaction and interface.
- Business Logic Layer: Manages business rules and logic.
- Data Access Layer: Handles data storage and retrieval.

This separation enhances maintainability, scalability, and code reusability, ensuring a streamlined development process and a robust foundation for your application.
